# Introduction
Re-implementing the original code for Jax/Haiku. Jax is considered to be the 
fastest deep learning framework at this time. Reimplementing OOD algorithms
has the benefit of faster training/inference, plus, the implementation is 
personally a way for me to learn in detail how the algorithms are implemented.

Further improvements to OOD approaches will be branched using this code as 
the base.
